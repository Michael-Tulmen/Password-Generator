This application is a random password generator that prompts the user for different data types before creating a randomized secure password for information security.

The passwords generated can have the following:
a user defined length between 8 and 128 characters
selections for lowercase, uppercase, numerical, and special characters
prompts that allow the user to select what type of characters they want to include in their password.

The generator employs arrays containing different character types which are concatenated based on the selection of the user at the various prompts.

A link to the deployed application is as follows: https://michael-tulmen.github.io/Password-Generator/
